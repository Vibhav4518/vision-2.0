# vision-2.0

Information Gathered:

Input from the student: list of subjects, their exam dates, and available study hours per day.
Output: a personalized study timetable allocating study sessions for each subject leading up to its exam.
Functionality: balance study hours based on exam urgency, distribute hours to all subjects, and provide a daily schedule.
UI: a user-friendly frontend that allows users to input their data and view the resulting timetable.
Technical: I'll implement this as a single HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript for easy use.
Plan:

Create a single-page application with a form to input:
Subjects and their exam dates.
Available study hours per day.
Process inputs in JavaScript to:
Calculate days till each exam.
Prioritize subjects based on how soon the exam is.
Allocate study hours accordingly, ensuring total does not exceed available hours per day.
Generate a timetable spread across days until exams.
Display the timetable in a visually appealing calendar or list format.
Style with modern, appealing design.
Make the app interactive and responsive.
Dependent files to be edited: none, a single HTML file with everything inline.
