• Subjects and their exam dates.
• Available study hours per day.
• Process inputs in JavaScript to:
• Calculate days till each exam.
• Prioritize subjects based on how soon the exam is.
• Allocate study hours accordingly, ensuring total does not exceed available hours per day.
• Generate a timetable spread across days until exams.
• Display the timetable in a visually appealing calendar or list format.
• Style with modern, appealing design.
• Make the app interactive and responsive.

Dependent files to be edited: none, a single HTML file with everything inline.
